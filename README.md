# Sudoku solver
A sudoku solving program written in C using naive backtracking.

Reads from a text file and prints solution to stdout.
Text file must be the values of each sudoku square if read from left to right, top to down.

Written to be adaptable to any sudoku size in mind but mainly for 3x3. As a naive algorithm is used, performance will be greatly reduced in larger sizes.
